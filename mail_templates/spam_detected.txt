{n} new lab account requests have been received. This exceeds the configured
spam threshold. The potentially fraudulent requests have been moved into a
temporary table in the database. To review these requests, ssh into the server
hosting this service and connect to the SQLite database.

Complete the review by deciding, for each request, to either:

- Delete and ignore the fraudulent request
- Review the honest request and, if you approve the request:
  - Create the account in Citadel with a temporary password
  - Send an email to the requestee with their temporary password
  - Add the request to the reviewed_requests table and update the audit log
- If you don't approve an honest request, send an email to the requestee telling
  them their request was denied.

The name of the table containing these requests is {tempTableName}. Make sure to
delete this table when you have finished.
